<h2><i>SPEECHES DELIVERED IN INDIA</i>,</h2>

<h3>1884&ndash;8.</h3>

<h4>INCLUDING THAT AT "THE ST. ANDREW'S
DINNER."</h4>

<h4><b>By the MARQUIS OF DUFFERIN AND AVA.</b></h4>

<p align="CENTER"><i>8vo. 9s.</i></p>

<p>"We earnestly commend the perusal of these speeches to the
English reader. They are the best possible antidote for the
rashness, ignorance, and folly which are the too common
characteristics of amateur criticism of Indian politics. They are,
moreover, agreeable reading; for Lord Dufferin, serious and well
considered as are his observations, is never dull, and, whenever
occasion permits, breaks away into a light-heartedness that reminds
us that he is a true Irishman, and that the Sheridan blood flows in
his veins. His touch is light; his spirits are gay; his fancy plays
at ease. Whenever, for a moment, the senatorial purple is thrown
aside, we perceive the courteous, kindly gentleman, sincerely
pleased with the world in which he has played so distinguished a
part, and the men and women whom his genial disposition and
charming manners have bound to himself in the firm allegiance of
personal affection. He is proud of his country, of his class, of
his past good fortune, and--as he takes every opportunity of
announcing--of his wife."--<i>Saturday Review</i>.</p>

<p>"In this charming collection there are not many speeches which
compare in importance and oratorical elevation with the brilliant
orations and despatches of Lord Dufferin's Canadian administration;
but we have a volume abounding in light on Indian history and rich
in hereditary refinement of diction and vivacity of perception....
The actual condition of the Indian Empire at the time Lord Dufferin
became Viceroy, and the healing influence his personality exercised
upon the inflammation produced by many attempts to exploit India
for party purposes, constitute some of Lord Dufferin's strongest
claims to recognition among the great men who have made the English
name renowned in the Indian world."--<i>Observer</i>.</p>

<h2><i>OUR VICEREGAL LIFE IN INDIA.</i></h2>

<h3>BEING A SELECTION FROM MY JOURNAL DURING THE
YEARS 1884&ndash;8.</h3>

<p align="CENTER"><b>By THE MARCHIONESS OF DUFFERIN AND
AVA.</b></p>

<p align="CENTER"><i>Fourth Thousand. With Portrait &amp; Map. 2
Vols. Crown 8vo. 24s.</i></p>

<p>"All who understand and sympathise with Indian life will hasten
to read these two pleasant volumes. The journal is a running
commentary on the multitudinous events which must crowd into such
years as she passed in India, and is none the less pleasant for its
simplicity and unpretentiousness. Perhaps the visit which Lady
Dufferin paid to Burmah three years ago will attract as much
attention as any other part of her travels."--<i>Daily
Telegraph</i>.</p>

<h2><i>A SOUTHERN PLANTER.</i></h2>

<p align="CENTER"><b>By SUSAN DABNEY SMEDES.</b></p>

<p align="CENTER"><i>Crown 8vo. 7s. 6d.</i></p>

<p>"The book is eminently worthy of the great attention it has
received. It puts the case of the Southern planters in a very
rational and most interesting light. It may be described as the
very antipodes to 'Uncle Tom's Cabin.' The picture of the rich,
affluent patriarchal life, with woodlands, pastures and countless
flocks, the master exercising paternal care over the slaves, and
the planter's wife, working harder for her slaves than any slave
could work, is extremely interesting and attractive. Then we have
some striking pictures of the war between Federals and
Confederates, and of the tremendous results. But the main charm of
the book is the character of Thomas Dabney himself, who might, as a
reality, be compared with some famous characters in fiction, with
the Doctor Primrose of Goldsmith, or the P&egrave;re Madelon of
Victor Hugo.... Mr. Gladstone has done well in drawing attention to
his character and his story."--<i>Literary Churchman</i>.</p>

<h2><i>FOUR YEARS' TRAVELS IN AUSTRALIA.</i></h2>

<h3>AND CAMP LIFE WITH THE ABORIGINES OF
QUEENSLAND.</h3>

<p align="CENTER"><b>By CARL LUMHOLTZ, M.A.,</b><br>
Member of the Royal Society of Science of Norway.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><i>With Maps, Coloured Plates and 120
Illustrations. Medium 8vo. 24s.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Lumholtz has a very pleasant and modest style of narrative,
so that the whole book is as agreeable as it is instructive; but
the portion most attractive from its novelty is that which details
his proceeding when, for nearly a year, he lived alone among 'a
race of people whose culture--if, indeed, they can be said to have
any culture whatever--must be characterised as the lowest to be
found among the whole genus <i>homo sapiens</i>.' The volume is one
of the most complete of its kind in all respects, and a worthy
record of the steadfast enterprise of a hardy Norseman in the
Scientific Age. It should be specially remarked that he effaces
himself more than most travellers; yet we can infer from the style
and fine temper of his narrative that he belongs to the higher
class of scientific explorers."--<i>Spectator</i>.</p>

<h2><i>A NATURALIST'S VOYAGE ROUND THE
WORLD</i>.</h2>

<p align="CENTER"><b>By CHARLES DARWIN, F.R.S.,</b></p>

<p align="CENTER">WITH MAPS AND UPWARDS OF 100 ILLUSTRATIONS OF THE
PLACES VISITED AND DESCRIBED.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><i>Chiefly from Sketches taken on the Spot by</i>
ROBERT TAYLOR PRITCHETT.<br>
<i>Medium 8vo. 21s.</i></p>

<p>*.* <i>The object of this edition is to aid the author's
description by actual representations of the most interesting
places and objects of Natural History referred to in them. This has
been effected by securing the service of an artist who has visited
the countries which Darwin describes.</i></p>

<p>"This is an edition de luxe of the first work written by our
great naturalist. Anybody who has read it is not likely to have
forgotten it. It is a kind of natural history 'Robinson Crusoe.' It
was during that famous voyage that Darwin made the observations and
laid the foundation for his famous theory of Natural Selection. The
present edition is by far the best and most attractive hitherto
published. The illustrations are artistic in the highest degree, as
everybody will understand when he knows they are by the artist of
Lady Brassey's 'Sunbeam.' Most of them are from sketches made on
the spot by Mr. Pritchett, with Darwin's book by his
side."--<i>Science Gossip</i>.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><b>By the DUCHESS OF CLEVELAND</b>.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><i>3 Vols. Small 4 to. 48s.</i></p>

<p>"These handsome volumes are a solid monument to the industry and
learning of the Author. On the whole the book is very much above
the average of Antiquarian productions. The accounts of the leading
families are given with accuracy and generally in an interesting
manner. The three volumes are evidently a labour of love, and
reflect no little credit on the industry, the knowledge and the
capacity of their Author."--<i>Guardian, May</i>, 1890.</p>

Chairman of the Inter-State Commerce Commission.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><i>With Maps, Charts, and 200 Illustrations. (480
pp.) Large 8vo. 31s. 6d.</i></p>

<p>"There is far more of interest and information in the book than
we have been able to allude to; and it is perhaps not entirely
unsatisfactory to the English reader to find, on the authority of
the Americans themselves, that with all their energy and
inventiveness, we are obviously still ahead of them in the art of
rendering railway travelling at once speedy and safe, and in
general principles and details. American engineers are behind no
others of this epoch in talent and resource, but American railway
working seems not yet to have surmounted the drawbacks arising from
an inherently loose system of construction and working, fixed upon
it at the outset by the desire for economy and by the lack of that
feeling of responsibility for public safety which seems much more
developed in the English character in connexion with public works
of this kind. England has the credit of having invented the railway
system, with all its vast consequences to the world, and we may be
allowed as a nation to feel some pardonable pride in the assurance
that in its working and management we are still in front of all
other nations."--<i>The Builder</i>.</p>

<p>"Although most people have some conception and experience of the
miracle of the age known as the railway, there are few who have
even a general understanding of it, and fewer still who possess
definite knowledge of its ramifications and details. Some such
summary as Mr. Acworth gives is requisite to convey a real and
lasting impression of the immensity of the organization and its
daily effect upon the present conditions of life."--<i>Birmingham

<h2><i>THE RAILWAYS OF SCOTLAND</i>.</h2>

<h3>THEIR PRESENT POSITION, WITH A GLANCE AT THEIR
PAST, AND A FORECAST OF THEIR FUTURE.</h3>

<p align="CENTER"><i>With a Map of the Scottish Railway System.
Crown 8vo. 5s.</i></p>

<p>"Mr. Acworth has lost no time in following up his interesting
book on English railways with a very readable companion volume.
This is a concise review of the past history of Scottish railway
enterprise, and a suggestive survey of the present outlook, with
its notable activity of competition and exploitation. From both
aspects Mr. Acworth's book, with its admirable map of existing
lines and lines in progress, is eminently satisfactory. Burning
questions of amalgamation or of competitive and retaliatory
policies are treated with discretion. They are discussed, as was
inevitable, but discussed within sober and proper
bounds."--<i>Saturday Review</i>.</p>

<h3>A SKETCH OF THEIR SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC
HISTORY.</h3>

<p align="CENTER"><b>By THOMAS MACKAY</b>.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><i>Crown 8vo. 7s. 6d.</i></p>

<p>"To any one, be he gentle or simple, who wishes to understand
how deep are the problems opening before the man who would
administer the poor law wisely and beneficently, we can honestly
commend this book of Mr. Mackay's. For ourselves, we have derived
much pleasure and not a little instruction from its
perusal."--<i>St. James's Gazette</i>.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><i>With 2 Maps and 36 Illustrations. 8vo.

<p>"Dr. Hickson ranks as the naturalist-historian of Malay
Archipelago, and is an undoubted authority on corals and the
general fauna of tropical seas. But he is more than a
naturalist--he is an ethnologist and a folklorist of high value.
This work is a valuable, conscientious, and pleasantly written
addition to the libraries of all who, with 'Childe Harold,'
'converse with Nature's charms, and view her shores unrolled.' The
maps are of especial value."--<i>Daily Telegraph</i>.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><i>With Map and Illustrations. Crown 8vo. 10s.

<p>"A charming little volume. Many of the towns along the coast
were visited by Mrs. Ross, and the leading events connected with
their history are very graphically described. These pages of Mrs.
Ross's will undoubtedly tempt many of her compatriots to visit this
fair unknown land, to its and the traveller's

<p align="CENTER"><b>By A.F. MUMMERY and J.A. HOBSON</b>.</p>

<p align="CENTER"><i>Crown 8vo. 6s.</i></p>

<p>"This is one of the most remarkable contributions to the
economic controversy lately seen. The authors set themselves out as
antagonistic to most of the received theories, and especially to
controvert Mill's position that 'saving enriches, and spending
impoverishes the community along with the individual.' The argument
is full of acute observation, and the industrial process, as we may
call it, is exposed to a careful scientific dissection.... The
volume is eminently readable and valuable."--<i>North British

pictures of idols, temples and relics."--<i>The Rock</i>.</p>

<p>"It would have been difficult to have found a more thoroughly

extraordinary amount of information, much of which appears for the

supplied, errors corrected."--<i>Edinburgh Review.</i></p>

<h2>UNIVERSITY EXTENSION MANUALS.</h2>

<hr align="center" width="33%">
<p>The Series of University Extension Manuals, to be published by
Mr. MURRAY, of Albemarle Street, London, under the Editorship of
Professor KNIGHT, of the University of St. Andrews, is primarily
designed to aid the University Extension movement throughout the
country, and to supply the need so widely felt by Students, of
Text-books for study and reference, in connection with the
authorised Courses of Lectures.</p>

<p>These Manuals will differ from those already in existence in
that they are not intended for School use, or for Examination
purposes; and that their aim is to educate, rather than to inform.
The enumeration of mere details will be avoided, except in so far
as they illustrate the working of general laws, and the development
of principles; while the historical evolution, both of the literary
and scientific subjects, will be kept in view, as well as their
philosophical significance. The class for whose use the Manuals are
especially designed are those whose education has been hitherto
somewhat miscellaneous or fragmentary, and who are desirous of
pursuing systematic study in Literature, History, Science, and
Art.</p>

<p>The remarkable success which has attended University Extension
in England and Scotland has been partly due to the combination of
scientific treatment with popularity, and the union of simplicity
with thoroughness. The University Extension movement, however, can
only reach those resident in the larger centres of population,
while all over the country there are thoughtful persons who desire
the same kind of teaching; and it is for them, as well as for the
Extension Lecture Students, that this Series is designed. Its aim
will be to supply to the public and to the general reader, the same
kind of teaching as is given in the Lectures, to reflect the spirit
which has characterised the movement, and to combine as the
Lectures have done, the discussion of principles as well as of
facts, and of methods along with results.</p>

<p>The Manuals will be issued simultaneously in England and
America. Volumes dealing with separate sections of Literature,
Science, Philosophy, History, and Art have already been assigned to
representative literary men, to University Professors, or to
Extension Lectures connected with Oxford, Cambridge, London, and
the Universities of Scotland and Ireland.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.net/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.net

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
